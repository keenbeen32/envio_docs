---

Envio offers a fully managed hosting solution for your indexers, providing all the infrastructure, scaling, and monitoring needed to run production-grade indexers without operational overhead.

Our hosted service offers multiple plans to suit different needs, from free development environments to enterprise-grade dedicated hosting. Each plan includes powerful features like static production endpoints, built-in alerts, and production-ready infrastructure.

## Deployment Options

Envio provides flexibility in how you deploy and host your indexers:

- **Fully Managed Hosted Service**: Let Envio handle everything. The following sections of this page outline the Fully Managed Hosted Service in more detail. This is the recommended deployment method for most users and removes the hosting overhead for your team. See below for the all the awesome features we provide and see the [Pricing & Billing](/HyperIndex/Hosted_Service/hosted-service-billing) page for more information on which Hosting plan suits your indexing needs.

- **Self-Hosting**: Run your indexer on your own infrastructure. This requires advanced setup and infrastructure knowledge not unique to Envio. See the following [repository](https://github.com/enviodev/local-docker-example) for a simple docker example to get you started. Please note this example does not cover all infrastructure related needs. It is recommended that at least a separate Postgres management tool is used for self-hosting in production. For further instructions see the [Self Hosting Guide](/HyperIndex/Hosted_Service/self-hosting)

## Key Features

- **Git-based Deployments**: Similar to Vercel, deploy your indexer by simply pushing to a designated deployment branch
- **Zero Infrastructure Management**: We handle all the servers, databases, and scaling for you
- **Static Production Endpoints**: Consistent URLs with zero-downtime deployments and instant version switching
- **Built-in Monitoring**: Track logs, sync status, and deployment health in real-time
- **Comprehensive Alerting**: Multi-channel notifications (Discord, Slack, Telegram, Email) for critical issues
- **Security Features**: IP/Domain whitelisting to control access to your indexer endpoints
- **GraphQL API**: Access your indexed data through a performant, production-ready GraphQL endpoint
- **Multi-chain Support**: Deploy indexers that track multiple networks from a single codebase

## Deployment Model

The Envio Hosted Service provides a seamless GitHub-integrated deployment workflow:

1. **GitHub Integration**: Install the Envio Deployments GitHub App to connect your repositories
2. **Flexible Configuration**: Support for monorepos with configurable root directories, config file locations, and deployment branches
3. **Automatic Deployments**: Push to your deployment branch to trigger builds and deployments
4. **Version Management**: Maintain multiple deployment versions with one-click switching and rollback capabilities
5. **Real-time Monitoring**: Track deployment progress, logs, and sync status through the dashboard

**Multiple Indexers**: Deploy several indexers from a single repository using different configurations, branches, or directories.

You can view and manage your hosted indexers in the [Envio Explorer](https://envio.dev/explorer).

<Info>
It is recommended that before deploying to the Hosted Service, the indexer is built and tested locally to ensure it runs smoothly on the Hosted Service.
For a complete list of local CLI commands to develop your indexer, see the [CLI Commands documentation](/HyperIndex/Guides/cli-commands).
