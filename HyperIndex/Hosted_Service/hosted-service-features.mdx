## IP Whitelisting

<Info>
**Coming Soon!** Full support for whitelisting is in active development.
</Info>

Control access to your indexer by restricting requests to specific IP addresses. This security feature helps protect your data and ensures only authorized clients can query your indexer.

**Benefits:**
- Enhanced security for sensitive data
- Prevent unauthorized access
- Control API usage from specific sources
- Ideal for production environments with strict access requirements

## Built-in Alerts

Stay informed about your indexer's health and performance with our integrated alerting system. Configure multiple notification channels and choose which alerts you want to receive.

<Info>
**Version Requirement**: This feature is only available for indexers deployed with version 2.24.0 or higher.

## Zero-Downtime Deployments

Update your indexer without any service interruption using our seamless deployment system with static production endpoints.

**How it works:**
- Deploy new versions alongside your current deployment
- Each indexer gets a **static production endpoint** that remains consistent
- Use 'Promote to Production' to instantly route the static endpoint to any deployment
- All requests to your static production endpoint are automatically routed to the promoted deployment
- Maintain API availability throughout upgrades with no endpoint changes required

**Key Features:**
- **Static Production Endpoint**: Consistent URL that never changes, regardless of which deployment is active
- **Instant Switching**: Promote any deployment to production with zero downtime
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Quickly switch back to previous deployments if needed
- **Seamless Updates**: Your applications continue working without any configuration changes

## Deployment Location Choice
