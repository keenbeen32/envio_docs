The Envio Hosted Service provides a seamless git-based deployment workflow, similar to modern platforms like Vercel. This enables you to easily deploy, update, and manage your indexers through your normal development workflow.

## Prerequisites & Important Information

### Requirements

- **Version Support**: Deployment on the Hosted Service requires at least version `2.21.5`. 
Additionally, the following versions are not supported: 
  - `2.29.x`
- **PNPM Support**: deployment must be compatible with pnpm version `9.10.0`
- **Package.json**: the `package.json` file must be present and include the above two requirements.
- **Configuration file**: a HyperIndex configuration file must be present (the name can be set in the [indexer settings](#configure-your-indexer))
- **GitHub Repository**: The repository must be no larger than `100MB`

Before deploying your indexer, please be aware of the following limits and policies:

### Deployment Limits
- **3 development plan indexers** per organization
- **Deployments per indexer**:  3 deployments per indexer
- Deployments can be deleted in the hosted service to make space for more deployments

### Development Plan Fair Usage Policy
The free development plan includes automatic deletion policies to ensure fair resource allocation:

#### Automatic Deletion Rules:
- **Hard Limits**: 
  - Deployments that exceed 20GB of storage will be automatically deleted
  - Deployments older than 30 days will be automatically deleted
- **Soft Limits** (whichever comes first): 
  - 100,000 events processed
  - 5GB storage used 
  - no requests for 7 days 

**When soft limits are breached, the two-stage deletion process begins**

#### Two-Stage Deletion Process

_Applies to development deployments that breach the soft limits_

1. **Grace Period (7 days)** - Your indexer continues to function normally, you receive notification about the upcoming deletion
2. **Read-Only Access (3 days)** - Indexer stops processing new data, existing data remains accessible for queries  
3. **Full Deletion** - Indexer and all data are permanently deleted

<Warning>
**Timeline Subject to Change**: The grace period durations (7 + 3 days) are subject to change. Always monitor your deployment status and upgrade when approaching limits.
</Warning>

## Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### Initial Setup

1. **Log in with GitHub**: Visit the [Envio App](https://envio.dev/app/login) and authenticate with your GitHub account
2. **Select an Organization**: Choose your personal account or any organization you have access to
3. **Install the Envio Deployments GitHub App**: Grant access to the repositories you want to deploy

### Configure Your Indexer

4. **Add a New Indexer**: Click "Add Indexer" in the dashboard
5. **Connect to Repository**: Select the repository containing your indexer code
6. **Configure Deployment Settings**:
   - Specify the config file location
   - Set the root directory (important for monorepos)
   - Choose the deployment branch

<Tip>
**Multiple Indexers Per Repository**: You can deploy multiple indexers from a single repository by configuring them with different config file paths, root directories, and/or deployment branches.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Monorepo Configuration**: If you're working in a monorepo, ensure all your imports are contained within your indexer directory to avoid deployment issues.
</Warning>

### Deploy Your Code

7. **Create a Deployment Branch**: Set up the branch you specified during configuration
8. **Deploy via Git**: Push your code to the deployment branch
9. **Monitor Deployment**: Track the progress of your deployment in the Envio dashboard

### Manage Your Deployment

10. **Version Management**: Once deployed, you can:
    - View detailed logs
    - Switch between different deployed versions
    - Rollback to previous versions if needed

## Monitoring

Once your indexer is deployed, you can monitor its health, performance, and progress using several built-in tools including the dashboard, logs, and alerts.

For detailed information about monitoring your deployments, see our [Monitoring Guide](/HyperIndex/Hosted_Service/hosted-service-monitoring).

## Continuous Deployment Best Practices and Configuration

For a robust deployment workflow, we recommend:

1. **Protected Branches**: Set up branch protection rules for your deployment branch
2. **Pull Request Workflow**: Instead of pushing directly to the deployment branch, use pull requests from feature branches
3. **CI Integration**: Add tests to your CI pipeline to validate indexer functionality before merging to the deployment branch

### Continuous Configuration

After deploying your indexer, you can manage its configuration through the `Settings` tab in the Envio dashboard:

#### General Tab

The General tab provides core configuration options:

- **Config File Path**: Update the location of your indexer's configuration file
- **Deployment Branch**: Change which Git branch triggers deployments
- **Root Directory**: Modify the root directory for your indexer (useful for monorepos)
- **Delete Indexer**: Permanently remove the indexer and all its deployments

<Warning>
**Deleting an Indexer**: Deleting an indexer is permanent and will remove all associated deployments and data. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

#### Environment Variables Tab

Configure environment-specific variables for your indexer:

- Add custom environment variables with the `ENVIO_` prefix
- Environment variables are securely stored and injected into your indexer at runtime
- Useful for API keys, configuration values, and other deployment-specific settings

<Tip>
**Environment Variable Best Practices**: Use environment variables for sensitive data rather than hardcoding values in your repository. Remember to prefix all variables with `ENVIO_`.
</Tip>

#### Plans & Billing Tab

Manage your indexer's pricing plan and billing:

- Select from available pricing plans
- Upgrade your plan to suit your needs
- View current plan features and limits

For detailed pricing information, see our [Pricing & Billing page](/HyperIndex/Hosted_Service/hosted-service-billing).

#### Alerts Tab

Configure monitoring and notification preferences:

- Set up notification channels (Discord, Slack, Telegram, Email)
- Choose which alert types to receive (Production Endpoint Down, Indexer Stopped Processing, etc.)
- Configure deployment notifications (Historical Sync Complete)

For complete alert configuration details, see our [Features page](/HyperIndex/Hosted_Service/hosted-service-features#built-in-alerts).

<Info>
**Alert Availability**: Alert configuration is available for indexers deployed with version 2.24.0 or higher on paid production plans.
