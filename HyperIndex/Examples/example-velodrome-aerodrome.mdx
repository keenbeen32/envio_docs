description: "Explore multi-chain Velodrome & Aerodrome DEX data with real-time tracking of pools, swaps, and liquidity."
---

This indexer provides a comprehensive implementation for tracking data from the popular Velodrome and Aerodrome decentralized exchanges across multiple chains.

## Overview

The [Velodrome & Aerodrome Indexer](https://github.com/enviodev/velodrome-indexer) demonstrates how to:

- Create a **multi-chain indexer** that works across Superchain networks
- Index core DEX functionality including pools, swaps, and liquidity positions
- Unify data access through a single GraphQL API
- Build efficient handlers using TypeScript
