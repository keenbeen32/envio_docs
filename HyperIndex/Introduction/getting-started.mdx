## Prerequisites

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Node.js" icon="node-js" href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/current">
    v22 or newer recommended
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="pnpm" icon="box" href="https://pnpm.io/installation">
    v8 or newer
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Docker Desktop" icon="docker" href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">
    Required for local development
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
Docker is required only if you plan to run your indexer locally. You can skip installing Docker if you'll only be using Envio's hosted service.
</Note>

## Initialize Your Indexer

Envio provides several ways to initialize an indexer depending on your needs:

### 1. Quickstart ([recommended →](/HyperIndex/contract-import))

Automatically generate an indexer based on one or more smart contracts deployed on a blockchain. Ideal for rapid development.

### 2. Templates

Quickly create an indexer using pre-defined templates:

- **ERC20** Template (Token standard)
- **Greeter** Template ([docs →](/HyperIndex/Tutorials/greeter-tutorial))

Run the following command to initialize using a template:

```bash >_ terminal
pnpx envio init
```

Select your preferred template from the interactive prompt.

### 3. Examples

Use existing example indexers as a starting point. You can find these examples in:

- [Envio Explorer](https://envio.dev/explorer)
- [Tutorials](/HyperIndex/Tutorials/tutorial-erc20-token-transfers)
- [GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/enviodev)

<Warning>
Always verify the Envio version used by the example indexer matches the [latest npm version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/envio). You may need minor adjustments to ensure compatibility.
</Warning>

## Essential Files

After initialization, your indexer will contain three main files that are essential for its operation:

1. **[`config.yaml`](/HyperIndex/Guides/configuration-file)** – Defines indexing settings such as blockchain endpoints, events to index, and advanced behaviors.
2. **[`schema.graphql`](/HyperIndex/Guides/schema-file)** – Defines the GraphQL schema for indexed data and its structure for efficient querying.
3. **[`src/EventHandlers.*`](/HyperIndex/Guides/event-handlers)** – Contains the logic for processing blockchain events.

<Note>
The file extension for Event Handlers (`*.ts`, `*.js`, or `*.res`) depends on the programming language chosen (TypeScript, JavaScript, or ReScript).
</Note>

You can customize your indexer by modifying these files to meet your specific requirements.

## Running Your Indexer

### Run Locally

You can easily test and run your indexer locally using Docker and Hasura:

<Steps>

<Step title="Navigate to your project directory">
```bash >_ terminal
cd your-indexer-directory
```
</Step>

<Step title="Ensure Docker is running">
Make sure [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is running on your machine.
</Step>

<Step title="Start the indexer">
```bash >_ terminal
pnpm dev
```

This command automatically launches your local environment and opens the Hasura dashboard, where you can view indexed blockchain data.
</Step>

</Steps>

**Local Hasura Admin Password:**

```
testing
```

#### Stopping the Indexer

When you're done, stop and clean up your local environment with:

```bash >_ terminal
pnpm envio stop
```

This will shut down and remove all Docker containers used for your local development environment.

For more detailed instructions, refer to our [guide to running the indexer locally](/HyperIndex/Guides/running-locally).

### Deploy to Hosted Service

Once you're ready, effortlessly deploy your configured indexer to Envio's hosted service and begin querying your endpoint immediately.

Check out our [hosted service documentation](/HyperIndex/Hosted_Service/hosted-service) for details on deployment and usage.
