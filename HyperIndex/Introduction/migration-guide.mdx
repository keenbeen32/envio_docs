Migrating from a subgraph to HyperIndex is designed to be a developer-friendly process. HyperIndex draws strong inspiration from TheGraph's subgraph architecture, which makes the migration simple, especially with the help of coding assistants like Cursor and AI tools (don't forget to use our [AI-friendly docs](/HyperIndex-LLM/hyperindex-complete)).

The process is simple but requires a good understanding of the underlying concepts. If you are new to HyperIndex, we recommend starting with the [Getting Started](/HyperIndex/getting-started) guide.

## Subgraph to HyperIndex Migration Overview

Migration consists of three major steps:

1. **Subgraph.yaml migration**
2. **Schema migration** - near copy paste
3. **Event handler migration**

At any point in the migration, run:

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
pnpm envio codegen
```

to verify the `config.yaml` and `schema.graphql` files are valid, or run:

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
pnpm dev
```

to verify the indexer is running and indexing correctly.

## Migration Steps

<Steps>

<Step title="Generate a boilerplate">
As a first step, we recommend using `npx envio init` to generate a boilerplate for your project. This will handle the creation of the `config.yaml` file and a basic `schema.graphql` file with generic handler functions.

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
npx envio init
```
</Step>

<Step title="Convert subgraph.yaml to config.yaml">
`npx envio init` will generate this for you. It's a simple configuration file conversion. Effectively specifying which contracts to index, which networks to index (multiple networks can be specified with Envio) and which events from those contracts to index.

Take the following conversion as an example, where the `subgraph.yaml` file is converted to `config.yaml`. The comparison below is for the Uniswap V4 pool manager subgraph:

**TheGraph - subgraph.yaml:**
```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="subgraph.yaml"
specVersion: 0.0.4
description: Uniswap is a decentralized protocol for automated token exchange on Ethereum.
repository: https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-subgraph
schema:
  file: ./schema.graphql
features:
  - nonFatalErrors
  - grafting
  - kind: ethereum/contract
    name: PositionManager
    network: mainnet
    source:
      abi: PositionManager
      address: "0xbD216513d74C8cf14cf4747E6AaA6420FF64ee9e"
      startBlock: 21689089
    mapping:
      kind: ethereum/events
      apiVersion: 0.0.7
      language: wasm/assemblyscript
      file: ./src/mappings/index.ts
      entities:
        - Position
      abis:
        - name: PositionManager
          file: ./abis/PositionManager.json
      eventHandlers:
        - event: Subscription(indexed uint256,indexed address)
          handler: handleSubscription
        - event: Unsubscription(indexed uint256,indexed address)
          handler: handleUnsubscription
        - event: Transfer(indexed address,indexed address,indexed uint256)
          handler: handleTransfer
```

**HyperIndex - config.yaml:**
```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
# yaml-language-server: $schema=./node_modules/envio/evm.schema.json
name: uni-v4-indexer
networks:
  - id: 1
    start_block: 21689089
    contracts:      
      - name: PositionManager
        address: 0xbD216513d74C8cf14cf4747E6AaA6420FF64ee9e
        handler: src/EventHandlers.ts
        events:        
        - event: Subscription(uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed subscriber)
        - event: Unsubscription(uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed subscriber)          
        - event: Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed id)
```

For any potential hurdles, please refer to the [Configuration File](/HyperIndex/Guides/configuration-file) documentation.
</Step>

<Step title="Migrate the schema">
`copy` & `paste` the schema from the subgraph to the HyperIndex schema file.

**Small nuance differences:**

- You can remove the `@entity` directive
- [Enums](/HyperIndex/Guides/schema-file#enum-types)
- [BigDecimals](/HyperIndex/Guides/schema-file#working-with-bigdecimal)
</Step>

<Step title="Migrate event handlers">
This consists of two parts:

**a. Converting AssemblyScript to TypeScript**

The subgraph uses AssemblyScript to write event handlers. The HyperIndex syntax is usually in TypeScript. Since AssemblyScript is a subset of TypeScript, it's quite simple to copy and paste the code, especially for pure functions.

**b. Converting the subgraph syntax to HyperIndex syntax**

There are some subtle differences in the syntax:

- Replace `Entity.save()` with `context.Entity.set()`
- Convert to async handler functions
- Use `await` for loading entities: `const x = await context.Entity.get(id)`
- Use [dynamic contract registration](/HyperIndex/Advanced/dynamic-contracts) to register contracts

**TheGraph - eventHandler.ts:**
```typescript icon="/icons/typescript-icon.png" title="eventHandler.ts"
export function handleSubscription(event: SubscriptionEvent): void {
  const subscription = new Subscribe(event.transaction.hash + event.logIndex);

  subscription.tokenId = event.params.tokenId;
  subscription.address = event.params.subscriber.toHexString();
  subscription.logIndex = event.logIndex;
  subscription.blockNumber = event.block.number;
  subscription.position = event.params.tokenId;

  subscription.save();
}
```

**HyperIndex - eventHandler.ts:**
```typescript icon="/icons/typescript-icon.png" title="eventHandler.ts"
PoolManager.Subscription.handler( async (event, context) => {
  const entity = {
    id: event.transaction.hash + event.logIndex,
    tokenId: event.params.tokenId,
    address: event.params.subscriber,
    blockNumber: event.block.number,
    logIndex: event.logIndex,
    position: event.params.tokenId
  }

context.Subscription.set(entity);
})
```
</Step>

</Steps>

## Extra Tips

HyperIndex is a powerful tool that can be used to index any contract. There are some features that are especially powerful that go above subgraph implementations. Here are some useful tips to optimize your migration:

- Use the `field_selection` option to add additional fields to your index. [Learn more →](/HyperIndex/Guides/configuration-file#field-selection)
- Use the `unordered_multichain_mode` option to enable unordered multichain mode, this is the most common need for multichain indexing. However comes with tradeoffs worth understanding. [Learn more →](/HyperIndex/Guides/configuration-file#unordered-multichain-mode)
- Use wildcard indexing to index by event signatures rather than by contract address.
- HyperIndex uses the standard GraphQL query language, whereas the subgraph uses a custom query language. You can read about the slight nuances [here](https://docs.sablier.com/api/caveats). (We are working on a basic tool to help with backwards compatibility - please check in with us on Discord for its current status).
- Loaders are a powerful feature to optimize historical sync performance. [Learn more →](/HyperIndex/Advanced/loaders)
- HyperIndex is very flexible and can be used to index offchain data or send messages to a queue for fetching external data. You can further optimize fetching by using the [Effects API](/HyperIndex/Advanced/effect-api).
