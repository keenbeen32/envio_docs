description: "Learn how to configure and manage Envio environment variables for your indexer."
---

Environment variables are a crucial part of configuring your Envio indexer. They allow you to manage sensitive information and configuration settings without hardcoding them in your codebase.

---

## Naming Convention

All environment variables used by Envio must be prefixed with `ENVIO_`. This naming convention:

- Prevents conflicts with other environment variables
- Makes it clear which variables are used by the Envio indexer
- Ensures consistency across different environments

---

## Envio API Token (Required for HyperSync)

To ensure continued access to HyperSync, set an Envio API token in your environment.

- Use `ENVIO_API_TOKEN` to provide your token at runtime
- See the API Tokens guide for how to generate a token: [API Tokens](/HyperSync/api-tokens)

---

## Envio-Specific Environment Variables

The following variables are used by HyperIndex:

- `ENVIO_API_TOKEN`: API token for HyperSync access (required for continued access in self-hosted deployments)
- `ENVIO_HASURA`: Set to `false` to disable Hasura integration for self-hosted indexers

- `MAX_BATCH_SIZE`: Size of the in-memory batch before writing to the database. Default: `5000`. Set to `1` to help isolate which event or data save is causing Postgres write errors.

- `ENVIO_PG_PORT`: Port for the Postgres service used by HyperIndex during local development
- `ENVIO_PG_PASSWORD`: Postgres password (self-hosted)
- `ENVIO_PG_USER`: Postgres username (self-hosted)
- `ENVIO_PG_DATABASE`: Postgres database name (self-hosted)
- `ENVIO_PG_PUBLIC_SCHEMA`: Postgres schema name override for the generated/public schema

---

## Example Environment Variables

Here are some commonly used environment variables:

```bash title=".env"
# Envio API Token (required for continued HyperSync access)
ENVIO_API_TOKEN=your-secret-token

# Blockchain RPC URL
ENVIO_RPC_URL=https://arbitrum.direct.dev/your-api-key

# Starting block number for indexing
ENVIO_START_BLOCK=12345678

# Coingecko API key
ENVIO_COINGECKO_API_KEY=api-key

# In-memory batch size (default 5000)
MAX_BATCH_SIZE=1
```

---

## Setting Environment Variables

### Local Development

For local development, you can set environment variables in several ways:

**1. Using a `.env` file in your project root:**

```bash filename=".env"
ENVIO_API_TOKEN=your-secret-token
ENVIO_RPC_URL=https://arbitrum.direct.dev/your-api-key
ENVIO_START_BLOCK=12345678
```

**2. Directly in your terminal:**

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
export ENVIO_API_TOKEN=your-secret-token
export ENVIO_RPC_URL=https://arbitrum.direct.dev/your-api-key
```

### Hosted Service

When using the Envio Hosted Service, you can configure environment variables through the Envio platform's dashboard. Remember that all variables must still be prefixed with `ENVIO_`.

For more information about environment variables in the hosted service, see the [Hosted Service documentation](/HyperIndex/Hosted_Service/hosted-service).

---

## Configuration File

For use of environment variables in your configuration file, read the docs here: [Configuration File](/HyperIndex/Guides/configuration-file).

---

## Best Practices

1. **Never commit sensitive values**: Always use environment variables for sensitive information like API keys and database credentials
2. **Never commit or use private keys**: Never commit or use private keys in your codebase
3. **Use descriptive names**: Make your environment variable names clear and descriptive
4. **Document your variables**: Keep a list of required environment variables in your project's README
5. **Use different values**: Use different environment variables for development, staging, and production environments
6. **Validate required variables**: Check that all required environment variables are set before starting your indexer

---

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with environment variables:

1. Verify that all required variables are set
2. Check that variables are prefixed with `ENVIO_`
3. Ensure there are no typos in variable names
4. Confirm that the values are correctly formatted
