---

The `config.yaml` file defines your indexer's behavior, including which blockchain events to index, contract addresses, which networks to index, and various advanced indexing options. It is a crucial step in configuring your HyperIndex setup.

After any changes to your `config.yaml` and the [schema](/HyperIndex/Guides/schema-file), run:

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
pnpm codegen
```

This command generates necessary types and code for your event handlers.

---

## Configuration Structure

Here's an example `config.yaml` file:

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml.svg" title="config.yaml"
# yaml-language: $schema=./node_modules/envio/evm.schema.json
name: Greeter
description: Greeter Indexer Example

contracts:
    - name: Greeter
      abi:
          - event: "NewGreeting(address user, string greeting)"
          - event: "ClearGreeting(address user)"

networks:
    - id: 1 # ethereum-mainnet
      start_block: 12345678
      contracts:
          - name: Greeter
            address: 0x9D02A17dE4E68545d3a58D3a20BbBE0399E05c9c
```

---

## Key Configuration Options

### Contract Addresses

Set the address of the smart contract you're indexing.

<Note>
Addresses can be provided in **checksum** format or in **lowercase**. Envio accepts both and normalizes them internally.
</Note>

**Single address:**

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
address: 0xContractAddress
```

**Multiple addresses for the same contract:**

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
contracts:
    - name: MyContract
      address:
          - 0xAddress1
          - 0xAddress2
```

<Tip>
If using a **proxy contract**, always use the **proxy address**, not the implementation address.
</Tip>

**Global definitions:**  
You can also avoid repeating addresses by using global contract definitions:

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
contracts:
    - name: Greeter
      abi: greeter.json

networks:
    - id: ethereum-mainnet
      contracts:
          - name: Greeter
            address: 0xProxyAddressHere
```

---

### Per-Contract Start Block Override

By default, contracts use the network `start_block`. Starting from `envio@2.27`, you can set a per-contract `start_block` to override it. Handy when:

-   Contracts were deployed at different blocks
-   You only need data from a contract starting at a specific block
-   You want to skip unnecessary historical data for some contracts
-   Works nicely with [Dynamic Contract Registration](/HyperIndex/Advanced/dynamic-contracts)

**Example with optional per-contract start_block override:**

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
networks:
    - id: 1 # ethereum-mainnet
      start_block: 18000000 # Default start block for all contracts on this network
      contracts:
          - name: ERC20Token
            address:
                - 0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111
                - 0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222
            start_block: 18500000 # Override for this contract
          - name: Greeter
            address: 0x9D02A17dE4E68545d3a58D3a20BbBE0399E05c9c
            # Uses network default (18000000)
```

---

### Events Selection

Define specific events to index in a human-readable format:

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
events:
    - event: "NewGreeting(address user, string greeting)"
    - event: "ClearGreeting(address user)"
```

By default, all events defined in the contract are indexed, but you can selectively disable them by removing them from this list.

#### Custom Event Names

You can assign custom names to events in `config.yaml`. This is handy when two events share the same name but have different signatures, or when you want a more descriptive name in your Envio project.

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
events:
    - event: Assigned(address indexed recipientId, uint256 amount, address token)
    - event: Assigned(address indexed recipientId, uint256 amount, address token, address sender)
      name: AssignedWithSender
```

---

### Raw Events Storage

By default, HyperIndex doesn't store raw event data in the database to optimize performance and reduce storage requirements. However, you can enable this feature for debugging purposes or if you need to access the original event data.

To enable storage of raw events, add the following to your `config.yaml`:

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
raw_events: true
```

When enabled, all indexed events will be stored in the `raw_events` table in the database, which you can view through the Hasura interface. This is particularly useful for:

-   Debugging event processing issues
-   Verifying that events are being captured correctly
-   Creating custom queries against raw blockchain data

Note that enabling this option will increase database storage requirements and may slightly impact indexing performance.

---

### Field Selection

To improve indexing performance and reduce credits usage, the `block` and `transaction` fields on events contain only a subset of the fields available on the blockchain.

To access fields that are not provided by default, specify them using the `field_selection` option for your event:

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
events:
    - event: "Assigned(address indexed user, uint256 amount)"
      field_selection:
          transaction_fields:
              - transactionIndex
          block_fields:
              - timestamp
```

See all possible options in the [Config File Reference](/HyperIndex/Advanced/config-schema-reference) or use IDE autocomplete for your help.

#### Global Field Selection

You can also specify fields globally for all events in the root of the config file:

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
field_selection:
    transaction_fields:
        - hash
        - gasUsed
    block_fields:
        - parentHash
```

Try to use this option sparingly as it can cause redundant Data Source calls and increased credits usage.

<Note>
Field Selection per Event is available from `envio@2.11.0` and above. Please upgrade your indexer to access this feature.
</Note>

---

### Unordered Multichain Mode

To improve indexing performance when indexing multiple blockchains, you can enable **Unordered Multichain Mode**. This setting allows parallel processing of events from different networks without strictly maintaining cross-chain event ordering. Useful for minimizing indexing latency when indexing at the head.

Activate this by adding to your `config.yaml`:

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
unordered_multichain_mode: true
```

Learn more about when and how to use this feature [here](/HyperIndex/Advanced/multichain-indexing#unordered-multichain-mode).

---

### Rollback on Reorg

HyperIndex automatically handles blockchain reorganizations by default. To disable or customize this behavior, set the `rollback_on_reorg` flag in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
rollback_on_reorg: true # default is true
```

See detailed configuration options [here](/HyperIndex/Advanced/reorgs-support).

---

### Preload Optimization

Enable [Preload Optimization](/HyperIndex/Advanced/preload-optimization) for your handlers.

This will make most indexers processing much faster without any additional code changes.

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
preload_handlers: true # default is false
```

Be aware of:

-   [Double-Run Footgun](/HyperIndex/Advanced/preload-optimization#double-run-footgun)
-   [Effect API for External Calls](/HyperIndex/Advanced/effect-api)
-   [Migrating from Loaders](/HyperIndex/Advanced/preload-optimization#migrating-from-loaders) (recommended)

---

### Environment Variables

Since `envio@2.9.0`, environment variable interpolation is supported for flexibility and security:

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
networks:
    - id: ${ENVIO_CHAIN_ID:-ethereum-mainnet}
      contracts:
          - name: Greeter
            address: ${ENVIO_GREETER_ADDRESS}
```

Run your indexer with custom environment variables:

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
ENVIO_CHAIN_ID=optimism ENVIO_GREETER_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddress pnpm dev
```

**Interpolation syntax:**

-   `${ENVIO_VAR}` – Use the value of `ENVIO_VAR`
-   `${ENVIO_VAR:-default}` – Use `ENVIO_VAR` if set, otherwise use `default`

For more detailed information about environment variables, see our [Environment Variables Guide](/HyperIndex/Guides/environment-variables).

---

### Schema File Path

You can customize the path to the [schema file](/HyperIndex/Guides/schema-file) using the `schema` option:

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
schema: ./path/to/schema.graphql
```

By default, the `schema.graphql` is expected to be in the root directory of your project.

---

### Output Directory Path

You can customize the path where the generated directory will be placed using the `output` option:

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
output: ./custom/generated/path
```

By default, the generated directory is placed in `generated` relative to the current working directory. If set, it will be a path relative to the config file location.

<Warning>
**Advanced Configuration**: This is an advanced configuration option. When using a custom output directory, you'll need to manually adjust your `.gitignore` file and project structure to match the new configuration.
</Warning>
