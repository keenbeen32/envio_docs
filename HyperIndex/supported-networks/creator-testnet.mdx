## Indexing Creator Testnet Data with Envio via RPC

<Warning>
RPC as a source is not as fast as HyperSync. It is important in production to source RPC data from reliable sources. We recommend our partners at [drpc.org](https://drpc.org). Below, we have provided a set of free endpoints sourced from chainlist.org. **We don't recommend using these in production** as they may be rate limited. We recommend [tweaking the RPC config](/HyperIndex/Advanced/rpc-sync) to accommodate potential rate limiting.
</Warning>

We suggest getting the latest from [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org).

### Overview

Envio supports Creator Testnet through an RPC-based indexing approach. This method allows you to ingest blockchain data via an RPC endpoint by setting the RPC configuration.

### Defining Network Configurations

To use Creator Testnet, define the RPC configuration in your network configuration file as follows:

<Info>
You may need to adjust more parameters of the [RPC configuration](/HyperIndex/Advanced/rpc-sync) to support the specific RPC provider.
