### Overview

Envio is a modular hyper-performant data indexing solution for Chainweb Testnet 21, enabling applications and developers to efficiently index and aggregate real-time and historical blockchain data. Envio offers three primary solutions for indexing and accessing large amounts of data: [HyperIndex](/HyperIndex/Introduction/overview) (a customizable indexing framework), [HyperSync](/HyperSync/overview) (a real-time indexed data layer), and [HyperRPC](/HyperRPC/overview) (extremely fast read-only RPC).

HyperSync accelerates the synchronization of historical data on Chainweb Testnet 21, enabling what usually takes hours to sync millions of events to be completed in under a minute—up to 2000x faster than traditional RPC methods.

Designed to optimize the user experience, Envio offers automatic code generation, flexible language support, multi-chain data aggregation, and a reliable, cost-effective hosted service.

To get started, see our documentation or follow our quickstart [guide](/HyperIndex/Introduction/contract-import).

### Defining Network Configurations

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
name: IndexerName # Specify indexer name
description: Indexer Description # Include indexer description
networks:
  - id: 5921 # Chainweb Testnet 21  
    start_block: START_BLOCK_NUMBER  # Specify the starting block
    contracts:
      - name: ContractName
        address:
         - "0xYourContractAddress1"
         - "0xYourContractAddress2"
        handler: ./src/EventHandlers.ts
        events:
          - event: Event # Specify event
          - event: Event
```

With these steps completed, your application will be set to efficiently index Chainweb Testnet 21 data using Envio's blockchain indexer.

For more information on how to set up your config, define a schema, and write event handlers, refer to the guides section in our [documentation](/HyperIndex/Guides/configuration-file).
