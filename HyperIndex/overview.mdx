<Info>
**HyperIndex & HyperSync**

**HyperIndex** is Envio's full-featured blockchain indexing framework that transforms on-chain events into structured, queryable databases with GraphQL APIs.

**HyperSync** is the high-performance data engine that powers HyperIndex. It provides the raw blockchain data access layer, delivering up to 2000x faster performance than traditional RPC endpoints.

While HyperIndex gives you a complete indexing solution with schema management and event handling, HyperSync can be used directly for custom data pipelines and specialized applications.

## HyperSync API Token Requirements

HyperSync (the data engine powering HyperIndex) implements rate limits for requests without API tokens. API tokens will be required from **3 November 2025**. Here's what you need to know:

- **Local Development**: An API token will be required. An automatic login feature from the CLI will be available to make this smoother.
- **Self-Hosted Deployments**: API tokens are required for HyperSync access in self-hosted deployments. The token can be set via the `ENVIO_API_TOKEN` environment variable in your indexer configuration. This can be read from the `.env` file in the root of your HyperIndex project.
- **Hosted Service**: Indexers deployed to our hosted service will have special access that doesn't require a custom API token.
- **Future Pricing**: From mid-November 2025 onwards, we will introduce tiered packages for those self-hosting hyperindex and wishing to use hypersync. For preferred introductory pricing based on your specific use case, reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Q9qt8gZ2fX).

For more details about API tokens, including how to generate and implement them, see our [API Tokens documentation](/HyperSync/api-tokens).
