title: "Indexing ERC20 Token Transfers on Base"
description: "Learn how to index and query USDC ERC20 transfers on Base using Envio."
---

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to index ERC20 token transfers on the Base network using Envio HyperIndex. By leveraging the no-code [contract import](/HyperIndex/Introduction/contract-import) feature, you'll be able to quickly analyze USDC transfer activity, including identifying the largest transfers.

We'll create an indexer that tracks all USDC token transfers on Base by extracting the `Transfer` events emitted by the USDC contract. The entire process takes less than 5 minutes to set up and start querying data.

## Prerequisites

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Node.js" icon="node-js" href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/current">
    v22 or newer recommended
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="pnpm" icon="box" href="https://pnpm.io/installation">
    v8 or newer
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Docker Desktop" icon="docker" href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">
    Required for local development
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
Docker is specifically required to run your indexer locally. You can skip Docker installation if you plan only to use Envio's hosted service.
</Note>

## Step 1: Initialize Your Indexer

<Steps>

<Step title="Run the init command">
Open your terminal in an empty directory and run:

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
pnpx envio init
```
</Step>

<Step title="Name your indexer">
We'll use "usdc-base-transfer-indexer" in this example:

<img src="/images/docs-assets/tutorial-base-erc20-transfer-2.png" alt="Naming your indexer" width="100%"/>
</Step>

<Step title="Choose your language">
Choose your preferred language (TypeScript, JavaScript, or ReScript):

<img src="/images/docs-assets/tutorial-base-erc20-transfer-3.png" alt="Selecting TypeScript" width="100%"/>
</Step>

</Steps>

## Step 2: Import the USDC Token Contract

<Steps>

<Step title="Select contract import">
Select **Contract Import** → **Block Explorer** → **Base**
</Step>

<Step title="Enter contract address">
Enter the USDC token contract address on Base:

```
0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913
```

[View on BaseScan](https://basescan.org/address/0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913)
</Step>

<Step title="Select the event">
Select the `Transfer` event:
- Navigate using arrow keys (↑↓)
- Press spacebar to select the event

<img src="/images/docs-assets/tutorial-base-erc20-transfer-4.png" alt="Selecting Transfer event" width="100%"/>

<Tip>
You can select multiple events to index simultaneously if needed.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Finish">
When finished adding contracts, select **I'm finished**

</Step>

</Steps>

## Step 3: Start Your Indexer

<Steps>

<Step title="Stop any running indexers (optional)">
If you have any running indexers, stop them first:

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
pnpm envio stop
```

<Note>
You can skip this step if this is your first time running an indexer.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Start your indexer">
```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
pnpm dev
```

This command:
- Starts the required Docker containers
- Sets up your database
- Launches the indexing process
- Opens the Hasura GraphQL interface
</Step>

</Steps>

## Step 4: Understanding the Generated Code

Let's examine the key files that Envio generated:

<Steps>

<Step title="config.yaml">
This configuration file defines:

- Network to index (Base)
- Starting block for indexing
- Contract address and ABI details
- Events to track (Transfer)

<img src="/images/docs-assets/tutorial-base-erc20-transfer-6.png" alt="Config YAML file" width="100%"/>
</Step>

<Step title="schema.graphql">
This schema defines the data structures for the Transfer event:

- Entity types based on event data
- Field types for sender, receiver, and amount
- Any relationships between entities

<img src="/images/docs-assets/tutorial-base-erc20-transfer-7.png" alt="GraphQL schema file" width="100%"/>
</Step>

<Step title="src/EventHandlers.*">
This file contains the business logic for processing events:

- Functions that execute when Transfer events are detected
- Data transformation and storage logic
- Entity creation and relationship management

<img src="/images/docs-assets/tutorial-base-erc20-transfer-8.png" alt="Event handlers file" width="100%"/>
</Step>

</Steps>

## Step 5: Exploring Your Indexed Data

Now you can interact with your indexed USDC transfer data:

<Steps>

<Step title="Access Hasura">
1. Open Hasura at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
2. When prompted, enter the admin password: `testing`

<img src="/images/docs-assets/tutorial-base-erc20-transfer-9.png" alt="Hasura login" width="100%"/>
</Step>

<Step title="Monitor indexing progress">
1. Click the **Data** tab in the top navigation
2. Find the `_events_sync_state` table to check indexing progress
3. Observe which blocks are currently being processed

<img src="/images/docs-assets/tutorial-base-erc20-transfer-10.png" alt="Indexing progress" width="100%"/>

<Note>
Thanks to Envio's [HyperSync](/HyperSync/overview), you can index millions of USDC transfers in just minutes rather than hours or days with traditional methods.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Query indexed events">
1. Click the **API** tab
2. Construct a GraphQL query to explore your data

Here's an example query to fetch the 10 largest USDC transfers:

```graphql icon="/icons/graphql-icon.png" title="Query Example"
query LargestTransfers {
  FiatTokenV2_2_Transfer(limit: 10, order_by: { value: desc }) {
    from
    to
    value
    blockTimestamp
  }
}
```

3. Click the **Play** button to execute your query

<img src="/images/docs-assets/tutorial-base-erc20-transfer-11.png" alt="Query results" width="100%"/>
</Step>

</Steps>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created an indexer for USDC token transfers on Base. In just a few minutes, you've indexed over 3.6 million transfer events and can now query this data in real-time.
