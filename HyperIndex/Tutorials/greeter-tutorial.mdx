title: "Indexing Greeter Contract Using Envio"
description: "Learn how to build and run a multi-chain indexer that tracks Greeter contract events using Envio."
---

## Introduction

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to indexing a simple Greeter smart contract deployed on multiple blockchains. You'll learn how to set up and run a multi-chain indexer using Envio's template system.

### What is the Greeter Contract?

The [Greeter contract](https://github.com/Float-Capital/hardhat-template) is a straightforward smart contract that allows users to store greeting messages on the blockchain. For this tutorial, we'll be indexing instances of this contract deployed on both **Polygon** and **Linea** networks.

### What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:

- A functioning multi-chain indexer that tracks greeting events
- The ability to query these events through a GraphQL endpoint
- Experience with Envio's core indexing functionality

## Prerequisites

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Node.js" icon="node-js" href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/current">
    v22 or newer recommended
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="pnpm" icon="box" href="https://pnpm.io/installation">
    v8 or newer
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Docker Desktop" icon="docker" href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">
    Required for local development
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
Docker is specifically required to run your indexer locally. You can skip Docker installation if you plan only to use Envio's hosted service.
</Note>

## Step 1: Initialize Your Project

First, let's create a new project using Envio's Greeter template:

<Steps>

<Step title="Run the init command">
Open your terminal and run:

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
pnpx envio init
```
</Step>

<Step title="Set the directory">
When prompted for a directory, you can press Enter to use the current directory or specify another path:

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
? Set the directory: (.) .
```
</Step>

<Step title="Choose your language">
Choose your preferred programming language for event handlers:

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
? Which language would you like to use?
> JavaScript
  TypeScript
  ReScript
```
</Step>

<Step title="Select Template initialization">
Select the **Template** initialization option:

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
? Choose an initialization option
> Template
  Contract Import
```
</Step>

<Step title="Choose the Greeter template">
Choose the **Greeter** template:

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
? Which template would you like to use?
> Greeter
  Erc20
```

After completing these steps, Envio will generate all the necessary files for your indexer project.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Step 2: Understanding the Generated Files

Let's examine the key files that were created:

<Steps>

<Step title="config.yaml">
This configuration file defines which networks and contracts to index:

```yaml icon="/icons/yaml-icon.png" title="config.yaml"
# Partial example
envio_node:
  networks:
    - name: polygon
      # ... Polygon network settings
      contracts:
        - name: Greeter
          address: "0x9D02A17dE4E68545d3a58D3a20BbBE0399E05c9c"
          # ... contract settings
    - name: linea
      # ... Linea network settings
      contracts:
        - name: Greeter
          address: "0xdEe21B97AB77a16B4b236F952e586cf8408CF32A"
          # ... contract settings
```
</Step>

<Step title="schema.graphql">
This schema defines the data structures for the indexed events:

```graphql icon="/icons/graphql-icon.png" title="schema.graphql"
type Greeting {
  id: ID!
  user: String!
  greeting: String!
  blockNumber: Int!
  blockTimestamp: Int!
  transactionHash: String!
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  latestGreeting: String!
  numberOfGreetings: Int!
  greetings: [String!]!
}
```
</Step>

<Step title="Event Handlers">
This file contains the logic to process events emitted by the Greeter contract.

The event handlers are located in `src/EventHandlers.js` (or `.ts`/`.res` depending on your language choice).
</Step>

</Steps>

## Step 3: Start Your Indexer

<Warning>
Make sure Docker Desktop is running before proceeding.
</Warning>

Start the indexer with:

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
pnpm dev
```

This command:

- Launches Docker containers for the database and Hasura
- Sets up your local development environment
- Begins indexing data from the specified contracts
- Opens a terminal UI to monitor indexing progress

The indexer will retrieve data from both Polygon and Linea blockchains, starting from the blocks specified in your `config.yaml` file.

## Step 4: Interact with the Contracts

To see your indexer in action, you can write new greetings to the blockchain:

### For Polygon:

1. Visit the contract on [Polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x9D02A17dE4E68545d3a58D3a20BbBE0399E05c9c#writeContract)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Use the `setGreeting` function to write a new greeting
4. Submit the transaction

### For Linea:

1. Visit the contract on [Lineascan](https://lineascan.build/address/0xdEe21B97AB77a16B4b236F952e586cf8408CF32A#writeContract)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Use the `setGreeting` function to write a new greeting
4. Submit the transaction

Since this is a multi-chain example, you can interact with both contracts to see how Envio handles data from different blockchains simultaneously.

## Step 5: Query the Indexed Data

Now you can explore the data your indexer has captured:

<Steps>

<Step title="Open Hasura">
Open Hasura at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

When prompted for authentication, use the password: `testing`
</Step>

<Step title="Browse the data">
Navigate to the **Data** tab to browse the database tables, or use the **API** tab to write GraphQL queries.
</Step>

<Step title="Run a sample query">
Try this query to see the latest greetings:

```graphql icon="/icons/graphql-icon.png" title="Hasura API"
query GetGreetings {
  Greeting(limit: 10, order_by: { blockTimestamp: desc }) {
    id
    user
    greeting
    blockNumber
    blockTimestamp
    transactionHash
  }
}
```
</Step>

</Steps>

## Step 6: Deploy to Production (Optional)

When you're ready to move from local development to production:

1. Visit the [Envio Hosted Service](https://envio.dev/app/login)
2. Follow the steps to deploy your indexer
3. Get a production GraphQL endpoint for your application

For detailed deployment instructions, see the [Hosted Service documentation](/HyperIndex/Hosted_Service/hosted-service).

- Customize the event handlers to implement more complex indexing logic
- Add relationships between entities in your schema
- Explore the [Advanced Querying](/HyperIndex/Advanced/loaders) features
