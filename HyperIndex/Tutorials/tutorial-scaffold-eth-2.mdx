## Introduction

The Scaffold-ETH 2 Envio extension makes indexing your deployed smart contracts as simple as possible. Generate a boilerplate indexer for your deployed contracts with a single click and start indexing their events immediately.

With this extension, you get:
- **Automatic indexer generation** from your deployed contracts
- **Status dashboard** with links to Envio metrics and database
- **One-click regeneration** to update the indexer when you deploy new contracts
- **GraphQL API** for querying your indexed blockchain data

## Getting Started

<Steps>

<Step title="Create a New Scaffold-ETH 2 Project">
Create a new Scaffold-ETH 2 project with the Envio extension already integrated:

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
npx create-eth@latest -e enviodev/scaffold-eth-2-extension
```
</Step>

<Step title="Start the Local Blockchain">
Navigate to your project directory and start the local blockchain:

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
cd your-project-name
yarn chain
```

This will start a local blockchain node for development.
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy Your Contracts">
In a new terminal window, navigate to your project directory and deploy the default smart contracts:

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
cd your-project-name
yarn deploy
```

This will deploy the default contracts to the local blockchain. This step is optional and can also be done once you've created your own smart contracts and deployed them using `yarn deploy`.
</Step>

<Step title="Start Scaffold-ETH Frontend">
From your project directory, start the Scaffold-ETH frontend:

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
yarn start
```

This will start the Scaffold-ETH frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate the Indexer">
Navigate to the Envio page in your Scaffold-ETH frontend at `http://localhost:3000/envio` and click the **"Generate"** button. 

<Note>
This should only be done once you've created a smart contract and ran `yarn deploy`. This will create the boilerplate indexer from your deployed contracts.
</Note>

The Envio page also includes a helpful "How to Use" section with step-by-step instructions.
</Step>

<Step title="Start the Indexer">
Navigate to the Envio package directory and start the indexer:

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
cd packages/envio
pnpm dev
```

This will begin indexing your contract events.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Regenerating the Indexer

When you deploy new contracts or make changes to existing ones, you'll need to regenerate the indexer:

### Via Frontend Dashboard

<Steps>

<Step title="Navigate to Envio page">
Go to the Envio page at `http://localhost:3000/envio`
</Step>

<Step title="Click Generate">
Click "Generate" to regenerate the boilerplate indexer
</Step>

</Steps>

### Via Command Line

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
cd packages/envio
pnpm update
pnpm codegen
```

<Warning>
Regenerating will overwrite any custom handlers, config, and schema changes, creating a fresh boilerplate indexer based on your deployed contracts. After regenerating, you'll need to stop the running indexer (Ctrl+C) and restart it with `pnpm dev` for the changes to take effect.
</Warning>
