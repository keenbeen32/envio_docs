description: Explore HyperRPC, fast read-only RPC for data-heavy blockchain queries and analytics.
---

HyperRPC is an extremely fast read-only RPC designed specifically for data-intensive blockchain tasks. Built from the ground up to optimize performance, it offers a simple drop-in solution with dramatic speed improvements over traditional nodes.

<Note>
**HyperSync vs. HyperRPC**

For most use cases, we recommend using [HyperSync](/HyperSync/overview) over HyperRPC.

HyperSync provides significantly faster performance and much greater flexibility in how you query and filter blockchain data. Behind the scenes, HyperRPC actually uses HyperSync to fulfill requests.

**When to use HyperRPC:**
- When you need a simple drop-in replacement for existing RPC-based code
- When you don't have time for a deeper integration
- When you're working with tools that expect standard JSON-RPC interfaces

**When to use HyperSync:**
- When performance is critical (HyperSync is much faster)
- When you need advanced filtering capabilities
- When you want more control over data formatting and field selection
- For new projects where you're designing the data access layer

## What is HyperRPC?

HyperRPC is a specialized JSON-RPC endpoint that focuses exclusively on **read operations** to deliver exceptional performance. By optimizing specifically for data retrieval workflows, HyperRPC can significantly outperform traditional nodes for data-intensive applications.

Key characteristics:

- **Read-only**: Optimized for data retrieval (cannot send transactions)
- **Drop-in compatible**: Works with existing tooling that uses standard RPC methods
- **Specialized**: Designed specifically for data-intensive operations like `eth_getLogs`

## Performance Advantages

Early benchmarks show that HyperRPC can deliver up to **5x performance improvement** for data-intensive operations compared to traditional nodes like `geth`, `erigon`, and `reth`.

This performance boost is particularly noticeable for:

- Historical data queries
- Log event filtering
- Block and transaction retrievals
- Analytics applications

## Supported Methods

HyperRPC currently supports the following Ethereum JSON-RPC methods:

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
<Card>
| Category | Methods |
| --- | --- |
| **Chain Data** | `eth_chainId`<br />`eth_blockNumber` |
| **Block Data** | `eth_getBlockByNumber`<br />`eth_getBlockByHash`<br />`eth_getBlockReceipts` |
| **Transaction Data** | `eth_getTransactionByHash`<br />`eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex`<br />`eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex`<br />`eth_getTransactionReceipt` |
| **Event Logs** | `eth_getLogs` |
| **Traces** | `trace_block` (only on [select chains](/HyperRPC/hyperrpc-supported-networks)) |
</Card>
</div>

## Supported Networks

HyperRPC is available across numerous EVM-compatible networks. For the most up-to-date list of supported chains, please see our [Supported Networks](/HyperRPC/hyperrpc-supported-networks) page.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
<Step title="Get Access">
Visit our [Supported Networks](/HyperRPC/hyperrpc-supported-networks) page to find all available HyperRPC endpoints. Each network has a ready-to-use URL that you can start using immediately.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Your API Token (Recommended)">
Requests without an API token will be rate limited starting **June 2025** (same timeline as [HyperSync](/HyperSync/api-tokens)).

Append your token to the endpoint URL:

```text
https://100.rpc.hypersync.xyz/<api-token>
```

If you don't have a token yet, you can generate one through the [Envio Dashboard](https://envio.dev/app/api-tokens).
</Step>

<Step title="Use Like a Standard RPC">
HyperRPC works with standard JSON-RPC calls:

```javascript icon="/icons/javascript-icon.png" title="fetch-logs.js"
// Example: Fetching logs with HyperRPC
const response = await fetch("https://100.rpc.hypersync.xyz/<api-token>", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
    id: 1,
    method: "eth_getLogs",
    params: [
      {
        fromBlock: "0x1000000",
        toBlock: "0x1000100",
        address: "0xYourContractAddress",
      },
    ],
  }),
});
```
</Step>

## Development Status

<Warning>
**Important Notice**

- HyperRPC is under active development to further improve performance and stability
- It is designed for read-only operations and does not support all standard RPC methods
- It has not yet undergone formal security audits
- We welcome questions and feedback in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Q9qt8gZ2fX)
