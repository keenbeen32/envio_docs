## What is HyperSync?

HyperSync is a purpose-built, high-performance data retrieval layer that gives developers unprecedented access to blockchain data. Built from the ground up in Rust, HyperSync serves as an alternative to traditional JSON-RPC endpoints, offering dramatically faster queries and more flexible data access patterns.

<Info>
**HyperSync & HyperIndex**

**HyperSync** is Envio's high-performance blockchain data engine that serves as a direct replacement for traditional RPC endpoints, delivering up to 2000x faster data access.

**HyperIndex** is built on top of HyperSync, providing a complete indexing framework with schema management, event handling, and GraphQL APIs.

Use HyperSync directly when you need raw blockchain data at maximum speed, or use HyperIndex when you need a full-featured indexing solution.
</Info>

## The Problem HyperSync Solves

Traditional blockchain data access through JSON-RPC faces several limitations:

- **Speed constraints**: Retrieving large amounts of historical data can take days
- **Query flexibility**: Complex data analysis requires many separate calls
- **Cost inefficiency**: Expensive for data-intensive applications
