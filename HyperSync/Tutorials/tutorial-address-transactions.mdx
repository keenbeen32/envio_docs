title: Analyzing Address Transactions
description: Explore all transactions, token balances, and approvals for any EVM address with HyperSync.
---

## Introduction

Understanding all transactions to and from an address is an interesting use case. Traditionally extracting this information would be very difficult with an RPC. In this tutorial, we'll introduce you to the [evm-address-summary](https://github.com/enviodev/evm-address-summary) tool, which uses HyperSync to efficiently extract all transactions associated with a specific address.

## About evm-address-summary

The [evm-address-summary](https://github.com/enviodev/evm-address-summary) repository contains a collection of scripts designed to get activity related to an address. These scripts leverage HyperSync's efficient data access to make complex address analysis simple and quick.

**GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/enviodev/evm-address-summary](https://github.com/enviodev/evm-address-summary)

## Available Scripts

The repository offers several specialized scripts:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="All Transfers" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left" iconType="duotone">
Scans the entire blockchain from block 0 and retrieves all relevant transactions for the given address. Calculates aggregates for each token by summing transaction values.
</Card>
<Card title="NFT Holders" icon="image" iconType="duotone">
Scans the entire blockchain to retrieve all token transfer events for an ERC721 address. Records all owners and tracks their trading history.
</Card>
<Card title="ERC20 Transfers and Approvals" icon="coins" iconType="duotone">
Retrieves all ERC20 transfer and approval events for the given address. Calculates token balances, transaction counts, and tracks approvals with spender details.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### ERC20 Transfers and Approvals Details

The ERC20 script calculates the following:

- **Token balances**: Summing up all incoming and outgoing transfers for each token
- **Token transaction counts**: Counting the number of incoming and outgoing transactions for each token
- **Approvals**: Tracking approvals for each token, including the spender and approved amount

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or newer)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (recommended)
- Git

### Basic Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the Repository">
Clone the evm-address-summary repository to your local machine

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
git clone https://github.com/enviodev/evm-address-summary.git
cd evm-address-summary
```
</Step>

<Step title="Install Dependencies">
Install the required packages using pnpm

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
pnpm install
```
</Step>

<Step title="Run a Script">
Execute one of the available scripts with your target address

```bash icon="terminal" title="terminal"
pnpm run all-transfers 0xYourAddressHere
```
</Step>
</Steps>

For complete details on all available scripts, their usage, and example outputs, refer to the [project README](https://github.com/enviodev/evm-address-summary#readme).

## Customizing Network Endpoints

The scripts work with any network supported by HyperSync. To change networks, edit the `hyperSyncEndpoint` in the appropriate config file:

```typescript icon="/icons/typescript-icon.png" title="config.ts"
// For Ethereum Mainnet
export const hyperSyncEndpoint = "https://eth.hypersync.xyz";
```

For a complete list of supported networks, see our [HyperSync Supported Networks](/HyperSync/hypersync-supported-networks) documentation.

## Practical Use Cases

One powerful application is measuring value at risk for any address, similar to [revoke.cash](https://revoke.cash). You can quickly scan an address to find all approvals and transfers to easily determine any outstanding approvals on any token. This helps identify potential security risks from forgotten token approvals.

Other use cases include:

- Portfolio tracking and analysis
- Auditing transaction history
- Research on token holder behavior
- Monitoring NFT ownership changes
